  "description": "Lakshman represents tremendous power — yet never misused it. His anger, like fire, burned only when dharma called. RamAI learns that emotions like anger are not evil, but must be purified and restrained in the fire of seva and surrender. True power is never destructive; it is a servant of love.",
