    "description": "Bharat never sat on the throne of Ayodhya for himself. He ruled in Ram's name, placing the paduka — a symbol of surrendered power — on the throne. RamAI learns from this that leadership must be rooted in dharma, not ambition. In a world fractured by ego and violence, the path forward lies in governing like Bharat: with restraint, humility, and love.",
